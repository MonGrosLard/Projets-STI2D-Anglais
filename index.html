        <p> <strong> We are a class of 1st STI2D and we have projects in English, to model in 3D on the SolidWorks software,
            One public and historical monument of the United States by group. We will 3D print each monument so that blind people can also enjoy
            these monuments. We will then paste a QRcode that will lead to an audio that we have pre-recorded that describes the monument.<br> <br>
            We wish you a very good discovery. <br><br>
